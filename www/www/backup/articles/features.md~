## Introduction

Sparqlify is a scalable SPARQL-SQL rewriter whose development began in April 2011 in the course of the [LinkedGeoData](http://linkedgeodata.org) project.

This system's features/traits are:
* Support of the ['Sparqlification Mapping Language' (SML)](http://sparqlify.org/wiki/SML), an intuitive language for expressing RDB-RDF mappings with only very little syntactic noise.
* Scalability: Sparqlify does not evaluate expressions in memory. All SPARQL filters end up in the corresponding SQL statement, giving the underlying RDBMS has maximum control over query planning.
* A powerful rewriting engine that analyzes filter expressions in order to eleminate self joins and joins with unsatisfiable conditions.
* Initial support for spatial datatypes and predicates.
* A subset of the SPARQL 1.0 query language plus sub queries are supported.
* Tested with PostgreSQL/Postgis and H2. Support for further databases is planned.
* CSV support
* R2RML will be supported soon
