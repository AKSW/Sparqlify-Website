## SPARQLify website

This repo hosts the sparqlify.org website. It is used for a research project on the distribution of websites.
It is based on harpJS, and meant to work out-of-the box by cloning this repository, compiling and starting the server. 
For more information on harp see [harpJS @HarpPlatform](https://www.harp.io/)

The design is based on the [Helios template](http://helios.harp.io), created by AJ at HTML5 UP


### Original Readme and License of the Helios template:
html5up.net | @n33co
Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)

This is Helios, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It's clean, modern, and designed
to take advantage of larger (well, wider) displays while still being capable of gracefully
scaling down to fit all manner of smaller ones.
